### Scope and Usage
The Danish Core DocumentReference profile is intended to encapsulate the data model of a DocumentReference as used in a Danish context of Document sharing, wether it is FHIR or CDA Documents and wether it is native XDS infrastructure or used in an MHD context [IHE MHD DocumentReference Minimal specification](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.2.2/StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.DocumentReference.html). 

In native XDS environments the instance of a DocumentReference resource MUST be translated to native IHE XDS metadata
<!-- The profile does this by imposing the MHD DocumentReference Minimal profile. -->
